# Overview

As an aspiring software engineer committed to improving programming knowledge and skills, I undertook the development of this project in Rust that spans across seven small projects and one large hangman game. Each module is designed to showcase different concepts in Rust, showing the difference of mutable and immutable variables, and how to implement loops, conditionals, expressions, and functions. This project serves as a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and the practical application of theoretical knowledge.

Description of my Hangman Game: This is a console-based Hangman game. It utilizes modular design with separate modules for the Hangman game logic (hangman) and word management (words). The game prompts the player to guess letters to uncover a randomly selected word related to programming in Rust. It enforces a maximum number of attempts, and the player wins by correctly guessing the word within the given attempts.

In summary, this comprehensive Rust project serves as a testament to my dedication to improving my programming skills. It demonstrates my progression from foundational concepts to the practical implementation of them, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and growth as a software engineer.

# Future Work

- Add some kind of graphic to show the hangman's noose.
- Figure out how to read the words from a CSV file so that it's easier to read or find words from a free API.
